# Happiness Journal
This project was inspired by a gift given to me by an old friend which was a journal with 365 pages to document things that made me smile every day for a year.

This website is dedicated to those who need reminders of things that made them happy, and things to be grateful for.

Current functionalities of the website are: registration, log in, log out, write, read and remove records.

This is a simple website developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask) and SQL.
